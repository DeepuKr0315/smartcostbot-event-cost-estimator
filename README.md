# UtsavAi Internship Round 1 Submission  
## SmartCostBot v3 – AI-Powered Event Cost Estimator & Negotiator  

### 🧠 About This Project

I built this tool because I wanted to explore how AI can help small businesses and planners estimate costs and simulate negotiations without relying on external APIs.

This is not a production-ready app — but a working concept showing how logic-based systems and open-source models can be combined for real-world problems.
